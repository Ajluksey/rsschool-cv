## About Me
---
I am 26 years old, currently working as a mechanic at a Zeekr, JLR, Exeed car dealer. Since childhood I have loved cars and working with my hands. However, after working as a mechanic for 6 years, I realized that let it be a hobby, and not my main income. Having experience in owning a PC and working in various applications, I hope to quickly master the specialty of front-end developer.
